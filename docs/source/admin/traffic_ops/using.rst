Traffic Ops - Using
*******************

.. deprecated:: 3.0
	The Traffic Ops UI is deprecated, and will be removed entirely in the next major release (4.0). A much better way to interact with the CDN is to :ref:`use Traffic Portal <usingtrafficportal>`, which is the the only UI that will be receiving updates for the foreseeable future.
