Traffic Server Administration
*****************************
Installing Traffic Server
=========================

#. Get the Traffic Server RPM and the astats RPM.

   Sample command: ::

      wget http://traffic-control-cdn.net/downloads/1.7.0/RELEASE-1.7.0/trafficserver-5.3.2-759.ee14bbe.el6.x86_64.rpm
      wget http://traffic-control-cdn.net/downloads/1.6.1/RELEASE-1.6.1/astats_over_http-1.2-8.el6.x86_64.rpm

   (astats was not released as part of 1.7, so in this examples 1.6.1 was used)
#. Install Traffic Server and astats: ::

    sudo yum -y install trafficserver-*.rpm astats_over_http*.rpm

#. Add the server using the Traffic Ops web interface:

   #. Select **Servers**.
   #. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Add Server**.
   #. Complete the *Required Info:* section:
      * Set 'Interface Name' to the name of the interface from which traffic server delivers content. 
      * Set 'Type' to 'MID' or 'EDGE'.

   #. Click **Submit**.
   #. Click **Save**.
   #. Click **Online Server**.

#. Install the ORT script and run it in 'badass' mode to create the initial configuration, see :ref:`reference-traffic-ops-ort` 

#. Start the service: ``sudo service trafficserver start``

#. Configure traffic server to start automatically: ``sudo chkconfig trafficserver on``

#. Verify that the installation is good:

   #. Make sure that the service is running: ``sudo service trafficserver status``

   #. Assuming a traffic monitor is already installed, login to the traffic monitor, and run the command from it: ::

        curl <traffic-server-name>/_astats

      Make sure you get a json full of values, and not an error.

Configuring Traffic Server
==========================
All of the Traffic Server application configuration files are generated by Traffic Ops and installed by way of the traffic_ops_ort.pl script. 
The traffic_ops_ort.pl should be installed on all caches (by puppet or other non Traffic Ops means), usually in /opt/ort. It is used to do the initial install of the config files when the cache is being deployed, and to keep the config files up to date when the cache is already in service.  The usage message of the script is shown below: ::

    $ sudo /opt/ort/traffic_ops_ort.pl
    Thu May 26 15:52:11 UTC 2016
    ====-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-====
    Usage: ./traffic_ops_ort.pl <Mode> <Log_Level> <Traffic_Ops_URL> <Traffic_Ops_Login> [optional flags]
      <Mode> = interactive - asks questions during config process.
      <Mode> = report - prints config differences and exits.
      <Mode> = badass - attempts to fix all config differences that it can.
      <Mode> = syncds - syncs delivery services with what is configured in Traffic Ops.

      <Log_Level> => ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, NONE

      <Traffic_Ops_URL> = URL to Traffic Ops host. Example: https://trafficops.company.net

      <Traffic_Ops_Login> => Example: 'username:password'

      [optional flags]:
        dispersion=<time>      => wait a random number between 0 and <time> before starting. Default = 300.
        retries=<number>       => retry connection to Traffic Ops URL <number> times. Default = 3.
        wait_for_parents=<0|1> => do not update if parent_pending = 1 in the update json. Default = 1, wait for parents.

Installing the ORT script
--------------------------

#. The ORT script is not a part of the traffic server distribution. You need to get and install in manually. In this sample session, we get it from github: ::

     sudo mkdir /opt/ort
     sudo wget -P /opt/ort https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-trafficcontrol/1.7.x/traffic_ops/bin/traffic_ops_ort.pl
     sudo chmod +x /opt/ort/traffic_ops_ort.pl

#. Install modules required by ORT: ``sudo yum -y install perl-JSON perl-Crypt-SSLeay``

#. For initial configuration or when major changes (like a Profile change) need to be made, run the script in "badass mode". All required rpm packages 
   will be installed, all Traffic Server config files will be fetched and installed, and (if needed) the Traffic Server application will be restarted.  
   
   Example run below: ::

      $ sudo /opt/ort/traffic_ops_ort.pl --dispersion=0 badass warn https://ops.$tcDomain admin:admin123

   .. Note:: First run gives a lot of state errors that are expected. The "badass" mode fixes these issues. Run it a second time, this should be cleaner.  
   .. Note:: Many ERROR messages emitted by ORT are actually information messages. Do not panic.

#. Create a cron entry for running ort in 'syncds' mode every 15 minutes. 
   This makes traffic control check periodically if 'Queue Updates' was run on Traffic Ops, and it so, get the updated configuration.

   Run ``sudo crontab -e`` and add the following line ::

  		*/15 * * * * /opt/ort/traffic_ops_ort.pl syncds warn https://traffops.kabletown.net admin:password > /tmp/ort/syncds.log 2>&1

   .. Note:: In 'syncds' mode, the ort script updates only configurations that might be changed as part of normal operations, such as:

      * Delivery Services
      * SSL certificates
      * Traffic Monitor IP addresses
      * Logging configuration
      * More stuff <To be completed>
