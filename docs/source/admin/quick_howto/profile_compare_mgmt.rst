*******************************
Profile Comparison / Management
*******************************
In Traffic Portal *all* users can compare the :term:`Parameters` of any 2 :term:`Profiles` side-by-side, and users with a higher level :term:`Role` ("operations" or "admin") can easily add or remove parameters from each profile as necessary.

The ability to compare and manage 2 profiles can be found under :menuselection:`Configure --> Profiles --> More --> Compare Profiles`

A superset of all parameters across the 2 profiles will be displayed with their profile membership displayed side-by-side. This view also provides users with higher level permissions ("operations" or "admin") the ability to easily remove or add parameters for each profile and persist the final state of both profiles (or restore the original state and discard changes). In addition, as the user makes changes, a blue shadow is added to all modified checkboxes.
