## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Per-DeliveryService Routing Names: you can now choose a Delivery Service's Routing Name (rather than a hardcoded "tr" or "edge" name). This might require a few pre-upgrade steps detailed [here](http://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/traffic_ops/migration_from_20_to_22.html#per-deliveryservice-routing-names)

### Changed
- Reformatted this CHANGELOG file to the keep-a-changelog format
