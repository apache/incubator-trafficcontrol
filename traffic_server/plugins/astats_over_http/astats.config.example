# wrap_counters
# wrap_counters when set to true, will keep the signed int64_t values within the range of INT64_MAX so that they remain positive
# and do not wrap to become negative in value.  Instead when they exceed INT64_MAX, they will start at 0 and begin counting
# from there.  This affects the TS_RECORDDATATYPE_COUNTER and TS_RECORDDATATYPE_COUNTER
# By default, wrap_counters is 'false'
