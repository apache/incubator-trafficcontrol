The emulated_vault module supplies a HTTP server mimicking RIAK behavior for the usage as traffic-control vault.
The server may use different type of persistent storage (e.g. file-system), using the proper adaptor.
Basic requirements: Centos ver >= 7; Python

In order to deploy the code on a server please:
1. Copy the module files to the server's root
2. Add the certificate and key to you favorite path
3. Adjust opt/emulated_vault/conf/cfg.json - pointing at your certificate and key
4. chkconfig the service

Logs may be found under /opt/emulated_vault/var/log

Developers notes:
------------------------
If you just want to play around with the module, you may of course run the server script on its own.
Before doing that, you would probably need to adjust the opt/emulated_vault/conf/cfg.json:
1. Changing the db-path to one you have access to
2. Disable ssl (just to make it easier)

Additionally, the vault-cmd script is also available to work against the DB with command line. 
It is mostly useful when developing a new adaptor.
