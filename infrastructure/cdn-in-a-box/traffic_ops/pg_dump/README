Do not remove this file or the docker build will fail as docker
will not copy an empty direcotry.

A postgresql backup file created with pg_dump may be included here
and the run.sh script will load it if PG_DUMP is defined in 
variables.env and the file it points too, is in this directory.

In variables.env: 

  PG_DUMP=to.pg_dump

'to.pg_dump' is installed in this directory.
